## Personalize your Invitation

First things first: let's create an invitation using HTML and CSS.

At a minimum, your invite should include info about when and where your party is taking place. If you don't want to start from scratch, you can customize [our invitation](https://github.com/Thinkful/uber-api-guide/tree/master/app/01-static-invitation).

For style ideas, check out [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts), [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) images, and the [Google Styled Maps Wizard](http://gmaps-samples-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/styledmaps/wizard/index.html).

__Note:__ If you're starting from scratch, make sure you make your invitation mobile-first and responsive! If you're not sure how, you can learn with a mentor's help in Thinkful's [Frontend Web Development](http://www.thinkful.com/web-development-course) course.
