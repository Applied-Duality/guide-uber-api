## Personalizing your Invitation

First things first: let's create an invitation template using HTML and CSS.

At a minimum, your invite should include some info about when and where your party is taking place. Similar to the image we shared above.

If you don't want to start from scratch, you can customize our invitation.
- Go to [the repo](https://github.com/Thinkful/guide-uber-api)
- Click "Download Zip"
- Open the zipped file
- Go to `app/01-static-invitation`
- Open `index.html` in your browser
- Modify `app/01-static-invitation/css/style.css` as you see fit

__Pro-tip__

For design: Use [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts) to find amazing (and free) fonts, [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) for images, and play around with [Google's Styled Maps Wizard](http://gmaps-samples-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/styledmaps/wizard/index.html).

If you're starting from scratch: Make sure your invitation is mobile optimized and responsive!
