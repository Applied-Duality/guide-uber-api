## Personalizing your Invitation

First things first: Let's create an invitation template using HTML and CSS.

At a minimum, your invite should include some info about when and where your party is taking place. Similar to the image you saw above.

If you don't want to start from scratch, you can customize our invitation template. To do this:
- Go to [the repo](https://github.com/Thinkful/guide-uber-api)
- Click "Download Zip"
- Open the zipped file
- Go to `app/01-static-invitation`
- Open `index.html` in your browser
- You can change the invitation design by modifying `app/01-static-invitation/css/style.css` as you see fit

__Pro-tip__

For design: Use [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts) to find amazing (and free) fonts, [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) for images, and play around with [Google's Styled Maps Wizard](http://gmaps-samples-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/styledmaps/wizard/index.html).

If you're starting from scratch: Make sure your invitation is mobile optimized and responsive. If you're not sure how to do this, you can join Thinkful's [Frontend Web Development Course](http://www.thinkful.com/web-development-course?utm_source=tf_uber_party_invite_guide&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=tf_guides) to learn this and much more with one-on-one mentorship.
